The project was created for personal use with family and friends and is presented as a result of my current skills.

The game takes place in real life, this program only simplifies the scoring system and other game nuances during the game.

## **Functionality:**

Main menu with 2 buttons: new game and continue. The clickability of the second depends on the presence of created players in the database. The menu also displays the leaderboard for the previous game.

The new game removes the entire list of players from the base, if they were there. Next, the number of players is set (2 <number<11), and the nicknames for each of them. Each entity "player" can be edited/deleted, that is, there is all the functionality of the CRUD. 

The game has 5 game modes:
- Default
- No trumps
- Misere
- Dark
- Gold

Each mode describes its unique features. More information about them and about the rules of the game can be found here *[rules of the game](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%80#%D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D1%8B)*. 

At the end of the whole game, the winner is displayed, 2nd place, 3rd ... and so on, with the option to go back to the main menu.

In the leaderboard there is an "Info" column where you can see the results of all the past games of each player with a date.
